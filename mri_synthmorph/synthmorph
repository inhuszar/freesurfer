# This wrapper script aims to simplify the use of SynthMorph containers by
# automatically pulling them from Docker Hub and mounting the host directory
# SUBJECTS_DIR to /mnt inside the container. You can use the script just like
# `mri_synthmorph` in FreeSurfer, except that all input and output files must
# be in SUBJECTS_DIR. If you use Docker or Podman, any path passed as an
# argument must begin with /mnt. For example, `export SUBJECTS_DIR=~/data` and
# pass /mnt/bert/out.mgz for a file at ~/data/bert/out.mgz. The environment
# variable SUBJECT_DIR defaults to the current working directory.

# pulling new images if you change the folder. Ignored for Docker and Podman.
