This file contains instructions for downloading and installing the file 
dependencies for the 'mri_histo_atlas_segment' util.

A general description of the utility and its usage can be found at:
    
    https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/HistoAtlasSegmentation

This utility requires file dependencies that not ship with the standard install
of FreeSurfer. This is done in an effort to keep the size of the installer
reasonable. The utility expects the files to be located under:

    $FREESURFER_HOME/python/packages/ERC_bayesian_segmentation/atlas

A zip file containing the file dependencies can be found at:
    
    https://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/dist/lcnpublic/dist/Histo_Atlas_Iglesias_2023/atlas.zip

Instructions for downloading, unpacking, and installing the dependencies:

    Download the zip file:
        Linux:
            wget https://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/dist/lcnpublic/dist/Histo_Atlas_Iglesias_2023/atlas.zip
        
        MacOS:
            curl -o atlas.zip https://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/pub/dist/lcnpublic/dist/Histo_Atlas_Iglesias_2023/atlas.zip

    Unpack the zip file (Same on Linux and MacOS):
        unzip atlas.zip

    Install files into the FreeSurfer build (Same for Linux and MacOS):
        Create the atlas dir if it does not exist:
            mkdir -p $FREESURFER_HOME/python/packages/ERC_bayesian_segmentation/atlas 
        
        Copy in the file dependencies:
            cp atlas/* $FREESURFER_HOME/python/packages/ERC_bayesian_segmentation/atlas 

To confirm that the files have been installed in the correct location, you should
see the files listed below in $FREESURFER_HOME/python/packages/ERC_bayesian_segmentation/atlas 

	label_001.npz - label_334.npz
	size.npy
